# Fatality-Data-Analytics-Practicum
Practicum Project with Elder Research &amp; CDC

Thank you for your time in exploring our visualizations.

To view the Tableau visualizations, please open the Tableau workbook 
‘Fatality Analytics.twbx’ in the 'Tableau viz' folder.
To successfully run, it will require Tableau version 10.3 or later.

The Tableau workbook is linked to an ‘R Shiny’ visualization in the second sheet.
(This visualization is useful to analyze how a selected ICD code interacts
with other codes.) To view this visualization, an R/R Studio environment will be needed.
First run ‘Co-ocurring_interactive.R’. Then run ‘app.R’. This will launch the
visualization. Once launched, it can also be viewed in the url that will be displayed 
in the R console when running the R Shiny App in R Studio. 
(Note: While running ‘Co-ocurring_interactive.R’, the file path to your local machine directory may need to be changed.)

Please reach out to us if you have any questions.
